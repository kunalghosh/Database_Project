This is a small database project I had done as a part of my coursework.
It uses PyQt for the Front-End, Python at the backend and Sqlite as the
database of choice.

I had chosen Sqlite because:
1. Python has native support for Sqlite.
2. Sqlite is very portable.(Portability was a requirement for the project at hand.)
